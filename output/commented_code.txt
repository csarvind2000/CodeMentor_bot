Here is the modified code with added docstrings in reStructuredText format for Python:

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Adds two integers together.

    Args:
        a (int): The first integer to add.
        b (int): The second integer to add.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the two input integers.
    """
    return a + b

class Calculator:
    """
    A simple calculator class with basic arithmetic operations.
    """

    def multiply(self, x: float, y: float) -> float:
        """
        Multiplies two floating-point numbers together.

        Args:
            self: The current instance of the Calculator class.
            x (float): The first number to multiply.
            y (float): The second number to multiply.

        Returns:
            float: The product of the two input numbers.
        """
        return x * y
```

Let me know if you'd like me to modify anything or add more docstrings!
